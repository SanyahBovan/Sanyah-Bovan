# Sanyah-Bovan

Hi my name is Sanyah, and I am currently a senior at Lane Technical high school. I am captain of the Lane Tech Champerrettes, and president of BSA. I enjoy a huge range of extracurriculars, and have been regarded as a well rounded student. I am apart of the Computer Science concentration here at Lane, and I've been taking CS classes since elementary school! I also enjoy photography so usually over the summer I take on a job that involves me sharpening my skills such as DePauls Next Level Photography, or at the Chicago Center Of Arts & Technology (CHICAT). In college I plan to study Biomedical/health Sciences. 


**My favorites** : Color - Pink , Food - Elotes , Snack - Ice Cream
